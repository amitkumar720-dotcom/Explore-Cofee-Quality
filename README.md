# Coffee Quality Analysis

## Project Description
This project investigates the quality of coffee by analyzing various sensory attributes using Power BI and Excel. It aims to uncover insights that can improve production techniques and promote sustainability in the coffee industry.

## Motivation
With coffee being a major agricultural product, understanding the factors that influence its quality is essential for producers. This project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help enhance coffee quality and support sustainable practices.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards to illustrate findings.
- **Excel**: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and preliminary analysis.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes sensory evaluations of coffee samples, focusing on attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and processing methods. It was sourced from industry reports, providing a comprehensive view of quality factors.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from reputable sources on coffee sensory attributes.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and organized the data in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Analysis**: Conducted statistical analyses to identify trends and correlations among the attributes.
4. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to effectively communicate the findings.

## Key Insights
- A significant relationship exists between aroma and overall quality scores.
- Processing methods greatly impact flavor and acidity levels.
- Specific coffee varieties consistently rank higher in quality assessments.

## Recommendations
- Implement improved processing techniques to enhance sensory attributes.
- Regularly monitor defect occurrences to optimize production quality.
- Encourage sustainable practices that benefit both producers and consumers.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data analysis in the coffee industry. By leveraging Power BI and Excel, valuable insights were uncovered that can aid in enhancing coffee quality and promoting sustainability. Future research could expand on additional sensory factors and their impacts.
